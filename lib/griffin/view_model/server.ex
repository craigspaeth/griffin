  A single model that encapsulates the entire view state of an app. This
  server-side version simply provides a convenient `set` function which
  is used to update a map. View models are expected to return the model state
  in each of their functions so that route controllers on the server-side can
  maintain immutability and pass a simple map to a `render` function.

  A convenience function that takes a model map and a keyword list of updates
  attributes as input, returning a deep merged update of the map as output.
